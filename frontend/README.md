# Dall-E Times

Final project for CSCA 5028 Applications of Software Architecture for Big Data.

My project is called "DALL-E Times" and is an experiment that combines the publicly
available news data with the image generation capabilities of OpenAI's DALL-E AI system.
The main idea is to take the top headlines from the day and use AI to generate images that
"summarize" the news. The main goal is to build experience using OpenAIs APIs and also
to experiment and see what kind of output it will produce given different types of headlines.
This project is geared towards people who are interested in the rising capabilities of AI
powered image generation. I believe this is a simple but unique idea that I haven't seen
done before, and could be a fun way of chronicling the news over time. I expect the output
will be quite bizarre but interesting!

## Getting Started

For security, the application will not run unless you have access to the private API keys.  If, however, you have those API keys, you can add them to your .env.local file and run the app as so....

```bash
npm run dev
```
